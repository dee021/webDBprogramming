The favicon was standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the HTML 4.01 recommendation, released in December 1999, and later in the XHTML 1.0 recommendation, released in January 2000.[8][failed verification][9][failed verification] The standard implementation uses a link element with a rel attribute in the <head> section of the document to specify the file format, file name, and location. Unlike in the prior scheme, the file can be in any Website directory and have any image file format.[10][11]

In 2003, the .ico format was registered by a third party with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) under the MIME type image/vnd.microsoft.icon.[12][13] However, when using the .ico format to display as images (e.g. not as favicon), Internet Explorer cannot display files served with this standardized MIME type.[13] A workaround for Internet Explorer is to associate .ico with the non-standard image/x-icon MIME type in Web servers.[14]

RFC 5988 established an IANA link relation registry,[15] and rel="icon" was registered in 2010 based on the HTML5 specification. The popular <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="image/favicon.png"> theoretically identifies two relations, shortcut and icon, but shortcut is not registered and is redundant. In 2011 the HTML living standard[16] specified that for historical reasons shortcut is allowed immediately before icon;[17] however, shortcut does not have a meaning in this context.
